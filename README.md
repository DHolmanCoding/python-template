# Python Template

Python boilerplate to kickstart your projects in style!

# Setting up Python and your Virtual Environment

This project template uses Poetry in order to manage the Python dependencies that you use within the project. There are
two types of dependencies: core dependencies and development dependencies. Core dependencies are those that are required
to be installed for the main, production release of your project or package. Development dependencies are auxiliary
packages that are useful in aiding in providing functionality such as formatting, documentation or type-checking, but
are non-essential for the production release.

For each dependency you come across, make a determination on whether it
is a core or development dependency, and add it to the pyproject.toml file from the command line using the following
command, where the `-D` flag is to be used only for development dependencies.
```
poetry add [-D] <name-of-dependency>
```

When you are ready to run your code and have added all your dependencies, you can perform a `poetry lock` in order to
reproducibly fix your dependency versions. This will use the pyproject.toml file to crease a poetry.lock file. Then, in
order to run your code, you can use the following commands to set up a virtual environment and then run your code
within the virtual envrionment. The optional `--no-dev` flag indicates that you only wish to install core dependencies.
```
poetry install [--no-dev]
poetry run <your-command>
```

# Initializing Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks in order to assist you in maintaining a uniform and idiomatic code style.
If this is your first time using pre-commit hooks you can install the framework [here](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).
Once pre-commit is installed, all you need to do is execute the following command from the repository root:
```
pre-commit install
```

If you want to execute the pre-commit hooks at a time other than during the actual git commit, you can run:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

# Containerizing your package

# TODO

1. Add additional pre-commit hooks that could be useful to users
2. Add documentation for each feature to help new users navigate the template better
3. Consider PyLint or flake8 and their compatibility with Black
4. Make a selection of circleci or github actions or both and add/test this feature
